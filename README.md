# Premier League Title Race #

This years (2018/19) premier league title race went down the wire between two teams, Manchester City and Liverpool. It was neck to neck till last game week and hence it is very intersting to visualize this using bar chart race.

I used [Flourish Studio](https://flourish.studio/) to craete this visualization. This is very simple process. You just need to get data into proper format and then it will create your visualization instantly.

1) first step was to scrape each week points table for premier league from [worldfootball.net](https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag) website. I used python BeautifuSoup package to scrape data and then formatted it into proper format so i can use that on flourish.
2) I uploaded scraped dataset on flourish site and with available template created this bar chart race for premier league teams
